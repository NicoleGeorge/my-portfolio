              A GUIDE FOR NEW LAW STUDENTS:<br />
              THE IMPORTANCE OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AT LAW SCHOOL Pt.1
            </h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">
              July, 2019 by <a href="../about.html">Nicole</a>
            </p>

            <p>
              This guide is designed to illustrate what academic misconduct
              entails, why it is critical to law students and what consequences
              are involved if a breach academic integrity is found. As first
              year law students, it is your responsibility to familiarise
              yourself with the Flinders University’s Academic Integrity Policy.
              It is our role as an institution, however, to impress upon you the
              importance of such inquiry and its impact to your future careers
              as lawyers. As the great Theodore Roosevelt once said; “to educate
              a person in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to
              society”.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h2>WHY IS ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AN ISSUE FOR LAW STUDENTS?</h2>
            <p>
              Academic integrity is at the heart of all higher learning
              institutions. Ideas, thoughts and research are valued in high
              esteem due to the vested commitment by those who have dedicated
              their lives to the betterment of society through research,
              intellectual inquiry and education. At tertiary level, academic
              integrity involves correctly attributing sources used in
              formulating arguments, research undertaken is recorded with
              accuracy and above all, honesty in claiming your work as your own.
              If one violates our policy, they will have engaged in academic
              misconduct, which is a serious breach of university ethos not just
              policy.
            </p>
            <p>To clarify, academic misconduct involves:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                anything that gives a student an unearned advantage over
                another. It includes the following; purchasing an essay;
                plagiarising paragraphs or whole texts; impersonating another to
                take a test; sneaking a speak at another student’s answers;
                smuggling notes into a test; padding a bibliography; fudging lab
                results; collaborating on an assignment when the professor asks
                for the individual work; or asking for an extension by citing a
                bogus excuse.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              For law students, correct referencing holds particular weight in
              the eyes of admitting bodies and the courts. It displays a
              student’s ability to cite their sources when examining thoughts
              and ideas so as to verify their arguments and the ability to
              honestly attest to those original sources when attribution call
              for it .
            </p>
            <p>
              On completion of your studies, in accordance with the Legal
              Practitioners Act 1981 (SA) , you will be applying to The Board of
              Admissions to obtain a license to practice law. Reasons pertaining
              the importance of academic integrity to law students are found in
              two key sections of the admissions requirements;
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                (a) that he or she is a fit and proper person to practice the
                profession of law
              </li>
              <li>
                (b) that he or she has complied with the rules of the Supreme
                Court.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The manner in which disclosures are made concerning to the above
              conditions, illustrates an applicants’ suitability for legal
              practice in the eyes of the courts. From a moral perspective, the
              bedrock of the legal profession is built upon the premise that
              'Legal practitioners must exhibit a degree of integrity which
              engenders in the Court and in clients unquestioning confidence in
              the completely honest discharge of their professional
              commitments'. Therefore, when a student displays a lack of
              academic integrity, it extends itself to more than a mere case of
              misattribution of a source, instead illustrating their lack of “a
              ‘commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental
              vales: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility’”.
              Thus, contravening the root of academic integrity itself, instead
              displaying elements of both “deceit and dishonesty” . It is
              imperative that law students understand that ‘failure to live up
              to expectations at university thus raises serious questions as to
              a person’s capacity for the similar dedication demanded of legal
              professionals’. The fundamental understanding of this bridge
              between a your academic endeavours and professional legal careers
              is what academic integrity holds at its core.
            </p>
            <h2>BURDEN OF PROOF: ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT & THE LEGAL PROFESSION</h2>
            <p>
              While the notion of cheating is a widely accepted immoral act,
              unfortunately plagiarism is not understood to be held to the same
              standards by all tertiary students . The courts, however, do not
              share this view. As rudimentary as the concepts of cheating in an
              academic setting, Kelly J attested during the Re Liveri legal
              admissions case, that cheating in an academic setting is not
              something that students needed to be governed by, for it was a
              universally sanctioned norm for legal professional to seek
              unauthorised assistance in their pursuit of an academic
              qualification .
            </p>
            <h3>key examples</h3>
            <p>
              The following cases have been selected to demonstrate academic
              misconduct, as they offer a cross-section of incidents committed
              by students while studying law at an Australian university. Miss
              Liveri’s admission was rejected due to 3 serious counts of
              plagiarism while attending James Cook University (JCU) .
              Plagiarism involves a person claiming the thoughts and ideas of
              another as their own due to either incorrect citation or
              intentional misattribution. During court proceedings, the
              applicant’s ‘lack of insight into the nature and gravity of the
              findings against her’ , notably Miss Liveri’s comments that JCU
              were ‘levelling’ charges against her showed a aura of negligence
              in taking responsibility for her transgression. Ultimately, it was
              the applicant’s lack of contrition that contributed to the
              applicant’s admission being rejected.
            </p>

            <p>
              Secondly, in the case in Re OG (A Lawyer), collusion and
              dishonesty which lead to his admittance to the legal profession,
              that were the central points of contention for the courts.
              Collusion involves two or more students, either discussing content
              of an assignment or sharing answers to an assignment, where the
              parameters of the task are clearly stipulated as being that of
              individual work as opposed to a collaborative effort. During
              hearings in Re OG, it was revealed that he did not make adequate
              disclosures, namely attesting to another’s actions which were
              found to be false, during his application for admission, resulted
              in him being struck off the roll. Further, Warren CJ stated that
              “his actions, therefore were the antithesis of a ‘realisation…of
              his obligation of candour to the court in which he desire[s] to
              serve as an agent of justice”. Throughout the process, OG
              continued to deflect his responsibility away from himself and onto
              his then classmate. The misinformation entangled within his
              disclosures, along with lack of candour during proceedings were
              strong factors in Warren CJ’s decision.
            </p>

            <p>
              In our final case, Miss Joy Onyeledo, the Applicant, contested
              serious charges against her relating to plagiarism. Her first
              application for admission was rejected by the Supreme Court of The
              Northern Territory . The Applicant did not disclosure her
              misconduct in its entirety within the application nor during
              initial proceedings. This brought her character into question and
              doubt was raised as to her ability to uphold the ethical
              obligations needed in the legal profession. The Applicant’s second
              application was successful after satisfying the courts of her
              fitness to practice. The Applicant achieved this by offering
              further disclosures to the court, whilst these may not have been
              integral to proceedings, her openness clearly demonstrated to the
              courts that she now understood the seriousness of her misconduct
              and made headways in rectifying her previous conduct.
            </p>
            <p>During the final judgement, Kelly J reasoned:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                The applicant had not intentionally passed off someone else’s
                work as her own but that the ‘academic dishonesty’ she had been
                found guilty of by the University was a result of poor essay
                writing and referencing skills. Therefore, the major concern was
                whether the Applicant sufficiently understood her ethical
                obligations of candour to the court and I have concluded that
                she does.
