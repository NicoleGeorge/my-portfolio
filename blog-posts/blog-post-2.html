              Cutrone's New Revolution: <br />A Theoretical Perspective
            </h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">
              August, 2018 by <a href="../about.html">Nicole</a>
            </p>

            <p>
              The Kelly Cutrone Millennial Leadership at People's Revolution. Is
              this a movement steeped in theory or is she paving the way in a
              new field of management? The fearless leader of the fashion PR
              firm People’s Revolution is second to none.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              A self-confessed role model, teacher and coach to her Millennial
              employees is refreshing, particularly in an industry that is
              renowned for a no holds barred approach to gettin’ business done,
              as Cutrone points out, “if anyone really wanted to change the
              world, they'd bring in the fashion b***hes”. With this attitude in
              mind when discussing the dynamics within the office space that is
              People's Revolution, Cutrone professes: “I think that my office is
              a research and development laboratory for the ultimate power
              chicks. It’s tribal and individual”....'nough said.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                On the surface, in an industry that is seen to be only skin
                deep, it could be assumed that Cutrone adopts a hierarchical
                organisational structure, where everybody knows their job…and
                their place. You could say that Cutrone’s style could be likened
                to Max Weber’s Bureaucratic theory of management, but that’s for
                another time...sometimes I have to tame the Geek Beast (but
                check out Farazmand, 2010, p.246 if you are interested...now get
                back in that cage). Testament to this assumption, her
                supervision of interns has been well documented on the
                now-defunct MTV reality show The City, as well as in her first
                novel If You Have to Cry Go Outside: and Other Things Your
                Mother Never Told You (...and between you and me, it's one
                freakin’ amazing read).
              </p>
              <p>
                These elements, however, cannot simply be reduced to a
                bureaucratic aristocracy, as an organisational discipline is
                seen to be contingent on the individual employees themselves, as
                opposed to one rudimentary management style. Then how is it that
                one can be at the helm of such a dynamic and intense
                organisation without ruling with an iron first? Well, it is
                obvious that each employee is different, therefore should be
                dealt with individually, a concept that Cutrone understands
                implicitly:
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              “I don’t treat any of my employees the same. Each come[s] with a
              different skill set and they each come with character defects”
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, the dominant managerial style can be present within a
              manager who advocates employee autonomy, where its assertion is
              reliant on individual circumstances. Although there is not just
              one approach in managing employees, research by Morse and Lorsch
              (1970) been found that the best approach is dependent on the
              nature of the work to be done.
            </p>

            <p>
              Particularly in the Fashion PR industry, where “highly uncertain
              tasks require more extensive problem solving, organisations are
              less formalised and emphasise self-control and member
              participation in decision making are more effective” (p.62), much
              to the testament of Kelly Cutrone's Millennial Leadership at
              People's Revolution. Further, newer research has shown it is
              important for organisations to tailor tasks, whereby a positive
              correlation exists between the fit and nature of the task to be
              completed (Morse and Lorsch, 1970)…Stephanie Pratt packing up a
              sample range anybody?...anybody?
            </p>
            <p>
              These sentiments are the foundations for the modern approach to
              this dichotomy, outlined in Contingency Theory (the Geek Beast is
              out of the cage, I repeat, it's out of the cage!!). It purports
              that a connection does exist between task, organisation and
              people, therefore, “the appropriate pattern of an organisation is
              contingent on the nature of the work to be done and on the
              particular needs of the people involved“ (p. 62)...Cutrone
              attempting to manage Roxy in Season 2 of The City perhaps?
              Therefore, it can be said that Kelly Cutrone’s People's Revolution
              is the embodiment of this new school of thought, whereby a
              nurturing and collaborative manager can adapt to situations and
              individual employee needs, where sometimes a dominant style needs
              to be drawn upon.
