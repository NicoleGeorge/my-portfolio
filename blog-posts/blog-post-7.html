            <p class="blog-post-meta">
              January 12, 2014 by <a href="../about.html">Nicole</a>
            </p>

            <p>
              I remember my fist thought after the introductory lecture to my
              final post-graduate course, Graduate Communication Management
              Project...'before I choose my topic I should consult my favourite
              investigative journalist. Josie Geller'. In her first article for
              the Chicago Sun Times, she opened with “In order to write well,
              you have to write what you know.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                And this is what I know”
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              So…the topic I chose was close to my own experiences growing up in
              a Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CaLD) Community. Living
              with my grandmother for a few years, I felt I had first hand
              experience in what it took to communicate within the elderly CaLD
              community. They are a tight knit bunch, where people tend to know
              everybody’s business, to which I can affirm in one statement: “the
              weekly Saturday morning shop at Torrensville Foodland” and to take
              poetic license on a quote from ‘Looking for Alibrandi’,  “Telstra
              would go broke if it weren’t for the [Greeks]”…so anyways...
            </p>

            <p>
              …I was excited. I was prepared. And I was so scared to write the
              research report. I had only one saving grace.
              <em>My insatiable love of databases</em>. I could quite possibly
              write a small novel, containing over 5000 references for that I am
              sure, on how to pull as much information from my good friends at
              EBSCO, Emerald, SAGE, Infomit, et al as possible. ‘This will
              surely get me through these tentative initial stages’, I said to
              myself, where the mere thought of conducting an extensive
              literature review left me more giddy than worrisome.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also came to the conclusion that on completion of this paper,
              and free access to said databases would cease, I will completely
              rip out all the necessary content I will need for future fashion
              blogging articles...Nerdy? Hells Yeah. Legal? Hmm not so sure…But
              I digress. Forgive me, the mere thought of databases does that to
              me.
            </p>
            <p>
              So after organising my placement I started to feel a little
              apprehensive about the whole experience. I think it was a
              combination of moving forward into the unknown and getting out of
              my comfort zone. I saw this, however, as a chance to grow within
              myself both personally and professionally. It was a good
              opportunity to give me a taste of what life could be like after I
              finish the course and embark on my career in Communications and
              Public Relations.
            </p>
            <p>
              After my placement came to an end, I was looking forward to
              getting my teeth into writing the report and analysing my data. I
              was excited, but I also starting to feel a little nostalgic about
              the whole post-graduate university experience coming to an end.
              Now, without sounding like an X Factor contestant who has just
              been booted off and is recapping in a poignant montage, I really
              felt that this project had been a real journey for me and I have
              come full circle. Admittedly there were plenty of ups and downs
              throughout this process. However, I honestly believe that it
              enabled me to grow. Through this course I have rediscovered my
              love for writing, something for which I will be forever in its
              debt.
            </p>
            <p>
              …On a side note, since I dedicated six months to the CaLD
              perspective, I thought about what languages I have come to learn
              over the years. Apart from the obvious English, I am also fluent
              in Grenglish [a hybrid of Greek and English that is considered
              completely acceptable within Australia], briefly dabbled in
              Italian and Chinese in Primary school [albeit compulsory courses
              which I can really only remember ‘Ni Hao’, ‘Ciao’ and the endless
              tales of ‘Pinocchio’] and through writing this lil’ retrospective
              I have also discovered that I speak fluent Movie Quotes and am
              very well versed in Pop Culture…after all, isn’t that the essence
              of relating to a diverse twenty first century public.
            </p>
            <p>
              And on that note, thank you and goodnight.
            </p>
