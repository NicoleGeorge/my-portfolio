            <p>
              Ok so, I have finally posted part 2, much later than expected
              but...sometimes life happens.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Following on from
              <a href="blog-post-5.html">Fashion PR: Buckle it Up Part 1</a>,
              where I touched on the fundamentals of PR, in this part I will
              endeavor to delve into the intricacies that encapsulates PR from a
              Fashion Industry perspective...Public Relations is not simply
              about creating a positive image, minimising bad publicity or
              creating a favourable climate of opinion. It is about creating
              understanding through knowledge, which more often than not
              involves effecting change. One of the main aspects of PR is its
              responsibility to the publics’ interest.
            </p>
              <p>
                An organisation is judged on its behaviour, and good PR is all
                about goodwill and reputation. This can be seen with Stella
                McCartney’s eponymous label, whose community work with
                environmental and animal rights causes, in which she is a
                staunch supporter both personally and professionally,
                communicates a climate of social responsibility. Company
                initiatives are strategically aligned with the brand, which not
                only uses natural and non-animal material in all its designs, it
                operates to minimise its carbon footprint in all its
                manufacturing and affiliated companies.
              </p>

            <h2>Heading</h2>
            <p>Contemporary Public Relations is seen as dynamic and flexible, 
                where practitioners must be responsive to environmental changes 
                and consumer trends that influence the organisation as a whole. 
                Fashion PR is all about relationship building, offering an open 
                two-way conversation between customers and forming strategic 
                partnerships with other companies that are aligned with the brand 
                to communicate its key messages. One of the vital roles in Fashion 
                PR is cultivating positive press and strong editorial coverage for 
                a label, whether it be in-house or through consultancy, as it has 
                the power to skyrocket a designer into the spotlight and drive demand 
                at store level (Gehlhar, 2008). This pull strategy can be implemented 
                when launching a new label or effecting change of an existing brand.
            </p>
            <h3>Case in point...the luxury British fashion house Mulberry.</h3>
            <img src="../img/mulberry-fashion-website.jpg" alt="" class="text-center">
            <p>
                Almost four years have past since the company was in the midst of 
                re-defining its brand, taking it from a ‘Mummsy’ leather goods house 
                to a coveted ‘IT’ status brand among the style set. How was this achieved 
                so seamlessly you may (...or may not) ask? Three words:<strong> Public. 
                Relations.</strong> The appointment of then new, now former, Creative 
                Director Emma Hill, who during her rein steered the label towards a 
                fresher horizon, didn’t hurt either.
            </p>
            <p>
                The company’s focus on strategically aligning its overall brand objectives 
                with key PR initiatives was a major contributing factor in the successful 
                re-branding of the Mulberry label. A key objective was to shift existing 
                consumer beliefs about the brand and increase awareness of the label amongst 
                targeted publics. Mulberry deployed a strong communications strategy with the 
                key message of celebrating the country-side established tradition of the brand 
                whilst realigning it with urban contemporary styles. This was achieved through 
                forming tactical partnerships, celebrity endorsements and key product 
                placements and event sponsorship.</p>
            <img src="../img/mulberry-coachella-2012.jpg" alt="" class="text-center">
            <p>
                Mulberry’s PR team saw an opportunity to leverage off the celebrity clout of Alexa Chung, a fan of the label for many years and deemed as a British style icon in the minds eye of the labels key demographic. Mulberry’s first assault on the fashion circuit was with the ‘Alexa’ bag, inspired by Chung. Then, you guessed it, the A-listers soon followed suit, toting around various incarnations of the original, resulting in strong editorial coverage in every major fashion weekly, tabloid, and newspaper internationally. Hailed as the next big thing in accessories at a time, where the resurgence of the ‘IT’ bag was beginning to gain momentum, it can be said that the PR plan surrounding the ‘Alexa’ bag single handedly took the company to a whole other level.

            <p>
                So, it can be said that fashion PR is much more about building strong relationships that benefit the company in a strategic and fiscal way…more so than meets the eye.
